# Virtual-Pet-Java-Program-
This was our first final group project submitted in our Computer Programming 1 Course. This game is a java program which gives the user with multiple options on what to do with their pet. Each action has its corresponding results and throughout the game, the health of the pet is tracked and must be maintained to prevent the pet from dying.
